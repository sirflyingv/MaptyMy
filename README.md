# MaptyMy

 My version of Jonas Schmedtmann's JS course project Mapty

Additions:
- "View all" button for fitting all workouts in viewport
- workout form hides when you click on sidebar
- workout objects are rebuilding from local storage as instances of right class, not just objects
- delete workout
- edit workout data and position
- delete all workouts
- sort workouts (with form to chose parameter and direction of sorting). Sorting affects only order of elements in sidebar, workout array isn't mutated
- modal window for confirmation of deleting anything
